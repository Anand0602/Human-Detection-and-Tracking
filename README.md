# Human-Detection-and-Tracking
This project develops a detection and tracking system to identify children and therapists in videos. Using YOLOv5 for object detection and multi-object tracking, it assigns unique IDs to each person. The tool aids in analyzing behaviors, emotions, and engagement levels of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
